class PolicyForest(BaseEnsemble, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """ Welfare maximization policy forest. Trains a forest to maximize the objective:
    :math:`1/n \\sum_i \\sum_j a_j(X_i) * y_{ij}`, where, where :math:`a(X)` is constrained
    to take value of 1 only on one coordinate and zero otherwise. This corresponds to a policy
    optimization problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default 100
        The total number of trees in the forest. The forest consists of a
        forest of sqrt(n_estimators) sub-forests, where each sub-forest
        contains sqrt(n_estimators) trees.

    criterion : {``'neg_welfare'``}, default 'neg_welfare'
        The criterion type

    max_depth : int, default None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default 10
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default 5
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default 0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, or None, default None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default 0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.
        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    max_samples : int or float in (0, 1], default .5,
        The number of samples to use for each subsample that is used to train each tree:

        - If int, then train each tree on `max_samples` samples, sampled without replacement from all the samples
        - If float, then train each tree on ceil(`max_samples` * `n_samples`), sampled without replacement
          from all the samples.

    min_balancedness_tol: float in [0, .5], default .45
        How imbalanced a split we can tolerate. This enforces that each split leaves at least
        (.5 - min_balancedness_tol) fraction of samples on each side of the split; or fraction
        of the total weight of samples, when sample_weight is not None. Default value, ensures
        that at least 5% of the parent node weight falls in each side of the split. Set it to 0.0 for no
        balancedness and to .5 for perfectly balanced splits. For the formal inference theory
        to be valid, this has to be any positive constant bounded away from zero.

    honest: bool, default True
        Whether the data should be split in two equally sized samples, such that the one half-sample
        is used to determine the optimal split at each node and the other sample is used to determine
        the value of every node.

    n_jobs : int or None, default -1
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :func:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : int, default 0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, or None, default None

        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If :class:`~numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState` instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the :class:`~numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState` instance used
        by :mod:`np.random<numpy.random>`.

    warm_start : bool, default False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.

    Attributes
    ----------
    feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        The feature importances based on the amount of parameter heterogeneity they create.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
