class SingleTreeCateInterpreter(_SingleTreeInterpreter):
    """
    An interpreter for the effect estimated by a CATE estimator

    Parameters
    ----------
    include_model_uncertainty : bool, default False
        Whether to include confidence interval information when building a
        simplified model of the cate model. If set to True, then
        cate estimator needs to support the `const_marginal_ate_inference` method.

    uncertainty_level : double, default 0.05
        The uncertainty level for the confidence intervals to be constructed
        and used in the simplified model creation. If value=alpha
        then a multitask decision tree will be built such that all samples
        in a leaf have similar target prediction but also similar alpha
        confidence intervals.

    uncertainty_only_on_leaves : bool, default True
        Whether uncertainty information should be displayed only on leaf nodes.
        If False, then interpretation can be slightly slower, especially for cate
        models that have a computationally expensive inference method.

    splitter : str, default "best"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_depth : int, optional
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, default 2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, default 1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default 0.
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, or None, default None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, or None, default None
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, optional
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default 0.
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

class SingleTreePolicyInterpreter(_SingleTreeInterpreter):
    """
    An interpreter for a policy estimated based on a CATE estimation

    Parameters
    ----------
    include_model_uncertainty : bool, default False
        Whether to include confidence interval information when building a
        simplified model of the cate model. If set to True, then
        cate estimator needs to support the `const_marginal_ate_inference` method.

    uncertainty_level : double, default 0.05
        The uncertainty level for the confidence intervals to be constructed
        and used in the simplified model creation. If value=alpha
        then a multitask decision tree will be built such that all samples
        in a leaf have similar target prediction but also similar alpha
        confidence intervals.

    uncertainty_only_on_leaves : bool, default True
        Whether uncertainty information should be displayed only on leaf nodes.
        If False, then interpretation can be slightly slower, especially for cate
        models that have a computationally expensive inference method.

    risk_level : float, optional
        If None then the point estimate of the CATE of every point will be used as the
        effect of treatment. If any float alpha and risk_seeking=False (default), then the
        lower end point of an alpha confidence interval of the CATE will be used.
        Otherwise if risk_seeking=True, then the upper end of an alpha confidence interval
        will be used.

    risk_seeking : bool, default False,
        Whether to use an optimistic or pessimistic value for the effect estimate at a
        sample point. Used only when risk_level is not None.

    max_depth : int, optional
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, default 2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, default 1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default 0.
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, or None, default None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    min_balancedness_tol: float in [0, .5], default .45
        How imbalanced a split we can tolerate. This enforces that each split leaves at least
        (.5 - min_balancedness_tol) fraction of samples on each side of the split; or fraction
        of the total weight of samples, when sample_weight is not None. Default value, ensures
        that at least 5% of the parent node weight falls in each side of the split. Set it to 0.0 for no
        balancedness and to .5 for perfectly balanced splits. For the formal inference theory
        to be valid, this has to be any positive constant bounded away from zero.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default 0.
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, or None, default None
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.
