"""Double Machine Learning. The method uses machine learning methods to identify the
part of the observed outcome and treatment that is not predictable by the controls X, W
(aka residual outcome and residual treatment).
Then estimates a CATE model by regressing the residual outcome on the residual treatment
in a manner that accounts for heterogeneity in the regression coefficient, with respect
to X. For the theoretical foundations of these methods see [dml]_, [rlearner]_, [paneldml]_,
[lassodml]_, [ortholearner]_.
