This directory contains 3 files (plus this readme file):
-- a codebook
-- a data set
-- an example sas program to read the data and process it.

The code book "code_bk.txt" gives the variables in the data set
and their means and min/max values. It also gives a reference for the
article by D. Card that the data is derived from.

The data set is  nls.dat = ascii file of data, 3613 obs

Finally, there a sas program,  read1.sas , a program that reads 
the nls.dat file and runs an example regression.
The varibles are named and explained in the file.
