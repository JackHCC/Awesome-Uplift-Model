因果推断用的最多的模型是 Rubin Causal Model (RCM; Rubin 1978) 和 Causal Diagram (Pearl 1995)。Pearl (2000) 中介绍了这两个模型的等价性，但是就应用来看，RCM 更加精确，而 Causal Diagram 更加直观，后者深受计算机专家们的推崇。

> Donald Bruce Rubin (born December 22, 1943) is an Emeritus Professor of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University). He is most well known for the [Rubin causal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model), a set of methods designed for [causal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal) [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference) with [observational data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_data), and for his methods for dealing with [missing data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data).
